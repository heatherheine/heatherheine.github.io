## COVID-19 Laboratory Leadership:

* **Transformation of Olive Labs (2020):** Converted my bootstrapped R&D lab into an FDA-authorized, CLIA-certified high-complexity clinical lab during the COVID-19 public health emergency.
* **Rapid Adaptation:** Mastered RT-PCR testing technologies, procured equipment, upgraded facilities, met regulatory requirements, hired staff, and implemented safe patient protocols—all within three months.
* **High Performance:** Achieved a 5-star Google rating, the highest among Michigan COVID-19 testing labs, based on unsolicited patient reviews.
* **Key Partnerships:** Supported Henry Ford Health Systems and DTE Energy (Michigan's main energy provider) to ensure staff safety during the 2020 winter.
* **Community Impact:** Tested thousands of long-term care facility residents with same-day results, prioritizing high-risk groups.
* **Support for Critical First Responders:** Provided testing and logistical support to critical first responders, including the senior team held up away from their families, who were responsible for the nearby Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station (Fermi 2) near Ferndale, MI, ensuring their operational continuity during the crisis.
* **Regulatory Engagement:** Collaborated with regulators and state lab scientists to manage resources under pressure.
* **Resource Management:** Anticipated and mitigated shortages of staff and supplies, maintaining operational efficiency.
* **Leadership Outcome:** Built a lab that delivered rapid, reliable testing, earning recognition from patients and corporate partners alike.

## Innovative Tissue Regeneration Research:

* **PhD Research at UBC:** Developed an implanted device for studying tissue regeneration during my PhD at The University of British Columbia (Patent PCT/US2013/023296, "Implantable devices and applications and use thereof").
* **Device Development:** Designed and fabricated device prototypes using various synthetic materials and surgical steel, and developed microsurgical techniques to support implantation and research applications.
* **Research Focus:** Created a controlled in vivo system for angiogenesis using a custom subcutaneous murine chamber and an automated high-resolution imaging system, incorporating confocal and multifocal confocal microscopy to image live tissues.
* **Key Contributions:**
  * Established baseline parameters for cell infiltration rates, capillary morphology, and effects of chamber size, matrix, and growth factor concentrations.
  * Conducted three pivotal experiments:
    * Implanted purified endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to evaluate their role in neoangiogenesis.
    * Used GFP-labeled bone marrow transplants to trace contributions to new vessel formation.
    * Analyzed angiogenesis in CD34-null mice, identifying altered penetration rates and cell densities.
* **Impact:**
  * **New Bioreactor Model:** This work introduces a new bioreactor model for studying tissue growth and regeneration, improving our understanding of how new blood vessels form in wounds and growing tissues.
  * **Significance:** Effective integration of engineered tissues with host tissues requires prior facilitation of angiogenesis, as vascular networks are essential for nutrient delivery and structural stability in constructs exceeding a few millimeters, underscoring my expertise in innovating and quantitatively analyzing complex biological systems.
  * **Research Efficiency:** The development of this model provides a powerful tool to monitor these changes in live mice, significantly increasing research efficiency in long-term studies.

## Advanced Training and Leadership:

* **MD/PhD at UBC:** Selected as one of only two students annually for UBC's highly competitive MD/PhD program, successfully managing demanding academics alongside leadership initiatives.
* **Entrepreneurial Leadership:** At age 25, led the fundraising, construction, and launch of UBC's first student-owned and operated café and coffee roaster, serving thousands and enhancing campus community engagement.
* **NASA Aerospace Medicine Training (2010):** Chosen as the only Canadian among five Americans for a month-long intensive at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, collaborating with astronauts and engineers to study medical systems for human spaceflight, bolstering expertise in high-pressure operational contexts.
* **Demonstrated Impact:** These accomplishments—establishing a sustainable student enterprise and contributing to space medicine—highlight my capacity to thrive in selective, high-stakes environments, delivering measurable results such as supporting a campus population and advancing knowledge in aerospace medicine.
