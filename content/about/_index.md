I am an MD/PhD biotechnologist and entrepreneur with a strong passion for innovation and a talent for big-picture planning. With over 15 years of clinical/research work in healthcare, and 12 years of startup entrepreneurship experience in the biotech sector, I possess an in-depth knowledge of the industry's nuances.

I have extensive experience leading cross-disciplinary teams of highly specialized scientists, engineers, and clinicians. Additionally, I have developed an intimate understanding of regulatory filing requirements such as CLIA, IRB, FDA, GLP, and ISO. I have established reimbursement pathways from US insurers and founded a high-complexity CLIA laboratory while scaling the operation and remaining compliant with ongoing FDA and CMS reporting requirements and inspections.

My expertise includes pathology, clinical diagnostics, regulatory affairs, implant design, surgery, robotics, and healthcare software.

I am meticulous with attention to detail and organizational skills, and I am able to provide both the 10,000 foot view as well as the day-to-day boots on the ground oversight associated with operations.

I am a visionary innovator and a seasoned project manager, community builder, and team leader. My expertise lies in asking insightful questions and seeking out relevant assistance to achieve my goals. My drive is to bring about transformative change in the field of medical research and its practical applications, with the aim of bettering patient outcomes and enhancing the quality of life for all.
