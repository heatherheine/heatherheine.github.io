</h2>
<p>In 2020, amidst the public health emergency brought on by COVID-19, I made the pivotal decision to transform Olive Labs, my bootstrapped R&amp;D laboratory, into an FDA-authorized, CLIA-certified high-complexity clinical laboratory. This shift demanded an intensive exploration of the technologies behind COVID-19 RT-PCR testing, alongside procuring new equipment, upgrading facilities, navigating regulatory requirements, hiring additional staff, and devising safe patient interaction protocols to protect our team. Remarkably, we accomplished this transformation in just three months, a testament to our agility and determination.</p>
<p>Our efforts paid off as we earned the highest 5-star Google rating among COVID-19 testing labs in Michigan, based on unsolicited patient reviews. We also supported major clients like Henry Ford Health Systems and DTE Energy—Michigan&rsquo;s primary energy provider—ensuring their staff&rsquo;s safety during the harsh 2020 winter, while testing thousands of long-term care facility residents with same-day turnaround times for these high-risk groups.</p>
<p>Leading Olive Labs during the pandemic placed me in frequent discussions with regulators and state laboratory scientists, where we tackled resource management under intense pressure. Anticipating and mitigating shortages of critical staff and supplies became a cornerstone of our operations, with time always of the essence. This experience sharpened my ability to identify and prioritize key elements to sustain a complex, efficient operation. Our lab&rsquo;s impact was tangible: we not only met urgent community needs but also set a standard for rapid, reliable testing, earning praise from both individual patients and corporate partners.</p>

  Innovative Tissue Regeneration Research

</h2>
<p>During my PhD at The University of British Columbia, I developed an implanted device for studying tissue regeneration, detailed in my thesis work (Patent PCT/US2013/023296, &ldquo;Implantable devices and applications and use thereof&rdquo;). My research focused on characterizing a controlled in vivo system for angiogenesis using a custom-built subcutaneous murine chamber, paired with an automated high-resolution imaging system.</p>
<p>This model established baseline parameters for cell infiltration rates, capillary morphology, and the influence of chamber size, matrix, and growth factor concentrations. I conducted three key experiments: implanting purified endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to assess their role in neoangiogenesis, using GFP-labeled bone marrow transplants to track contributions to new vessel formation, and analyzing angiogenesis in CD34-null mice, revealing altered penetration rates and cell densities.</p>
<p>This work, published in 2009, laid a foundation for future therapeutic advancements in neoangiogenesis, showcasing my ability to innovate and quantify complex biological processes.</p>

  Exceptional Training &amp;amp; Leadership
  <a class="anchor" href="#exceptional-training--leadership">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As one of only two students annually accepted into UBC&rsquo;s prestigious MD/PhD program, I balanced rigorous academics with entrepreneurial leadership. At age 25, I spearheaded the fundraising, construction, and launch of UBC&rsquo;s first student-owned and operated café and coffee roaster, a venture that served thousands and fostered community on campus.</p>
<p>Additionally, in 2010, I was the sole Canadian selected among five Americans for NASA&rsquo;s Aerospace Medicine training at Johnson Space Center in Houston. This month-long intensive with astronauts and engineers covered human spaceflight medical systems, enhancing my expertise in high-stakes operational environments.</p>
<p>These achievements—building a sustainable student enterprise and training with NASA—demonstrate my ability to excel in selective, high-impact settings, with quantifiable outcomes like serving a campus population and contributing to space medicine knowledge.</p>
